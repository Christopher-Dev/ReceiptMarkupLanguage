    <h2>Welcome to Receipt Markup Language or RML</h2>
    <p>
        Receipt Markup Language (RML) is a quick and efficient tool for generating receipts within Windows-based applications or hosted tools. With simple integration through a single NuGet package, RML enables C# developers to start generating receipts with just a few lines of code. Combining XML’s ease of use with WPF-inspired syntax, RML offers an intuitive, browser-based environment for building, editing, and rendering receipts effortlessly on Windows.
